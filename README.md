## Operational Efficiency Report: Key Insights and Opportunities
1. The Core Problem: Delays are Localized, Not Universal
The dashboard confirms that the primary threat to time efficiency is geographically concentrated.

Diagnosis (Fig 1): The "Average Delay by City" chart, when unfiltered, highlights Kano as the consistent underperformer with the highest average delay.

Actionable Insight: Use the City Filter to drill down into Kano. If the delay remains high even when filtering for "All" months, the issue lies in route structure or persistent traffic patterns. If the delay disappears when filtering for a specific month (e.g., May), the issue was temporary congestion or a staffing shortage during that period.

2. Cost Control is Systemic and Stable
Cost challenges relate to external factors, not localized operational failure.

Cost Stability (Fig 2): The tight clustering of cities on the Cost per km axis confirms that high costs affect everyone equally, validating the COO's concern about rising fuel costs as a macroeconomic or fleet-wide problem.

Trend Confirmation (Fig 4): The "Monthly Trend" chart will show if the Cost per km line is trending upward. This ongoing trend requires a systemic, non-operational intervention, such as adjusting pricing models or negotiating better fuel rates.

3. Utilization and Uneven Workload Diagnosis
The Deliveries per Vehicle measures asset efficiency, addressing the "uneven workload" concern.

Workload Imbalance (Fig 3): The box plot reveals high variance, pointing to vehicles that are over- or under-utilized.

Actionable Insight: Filter the dashboard by a single city (e.g., Lagos) and observe the Deliveries per Vehicle (Avg) KPI. If the number drops significantly, it means Lagos has many idle vehicles. If the number remains high, it confirms vehicle saturation. This isolates the location of the spare or underutilized assets.

Management Actions Required
Time Efficiency: Focus resources exclusively on operational review for the Kano region to reduce delays, using the Month filter to determine if the cause is chronic or seasonal.

Cost Efficiency: Since costs are stable across cities, implement fleet-wide fuel procurement strategies and use the Cost per Kilometer KPI to benchmark success.

Asset Utilization: Use the City Filter to pinpoint regions with low Deliveries per Vehicle outliers (Fig 3). Reallocate or retire underutilized vehicles to optimize capital.
